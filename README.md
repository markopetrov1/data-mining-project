## Overview

This project explores various regression and classification models applied to a single dataset. The goal is to analyze the performance of different machine learning algorithms and compare their accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and other relevant metrics. By experimenting with different models and techniques, the goal is to identify the most effective approach for predicting the target variables.


## Dataset
The dataset is for tunnels, originating from the Faculty of Civil Engineering at Ss Cyril and Methodius University in Skopje, Macedonia. There are a total of 109 rows and 11 columns (attributes). We have three target columns: RMR, Quality Index and Modulus of deformations.

## Models Explored
The following regression and classification models are explored in this project:

- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Random Forest Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Neural Network Classifier

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

Model Training: Train each machine learning model using the preprocessed dataset.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, MSE, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Comparison and Analysis: Compare the results of different models and analyze their overall performance. Identify the best-performing models for regression and classification tasks.
